## 🔬 Research Focus

I am a researcher bridging the gap between **Geospatial Analysis** and **Ecosystem Conservation**. My work focuses on quantifying carbon dynamics in Andean-Amazonian landscapes using Earth Observation (EO) data and Machine Learning.

Currently seeking international collaborations in:
* Global Carbon Cycle Monitoring.
* Hydrological Modelling in Tropical Basins.
* Application of Deep Learning for Land Cover Classification.
