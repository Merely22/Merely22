## 👋 About Me

🍃🗺️ Hi! I'm Merely, a Geographical Engineer passionate about understanding the world through geosciences. 
My work combines environmental science with data-driven solutions to understand carbon stocks and climate patterns in Andean-Amazonian ecosystems.
🌳🌍 I am always looking to collaborate on international research projects, funded opportunities, and initiatives that leverage geotechnologies for climate action.
